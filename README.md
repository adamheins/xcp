# xcp
A simple shell script that provides commands to cut, copy, and paste files from
the command line. The motivation and basic usage is explained in [this blog
post](https://adamheins.com/blog/cut-copy-paste-files-cli).

I had previously implemented similar functionality as a much more complicated
Python tool, which you can see in earlier commits of this repo.
